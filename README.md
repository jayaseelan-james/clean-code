## Introduction

- There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work.
- Master craftsmanship by learning key concepts and deeply internalizing them through hard work and
  consistent practice.
- Knowing the theory isn't enough; like riding a bike, coding requires hands-on practice to truly
  learn and improve.
- Clean code takes hard work and practice. You must struggle, fail, and learn from your own and
  others' mistakes to truly master it.

## Chapter 1: Clean Code

### There Will Be Code

- You're reading this because you're a programmer who wants to improve, and the world needs more
  skilled programmers.
- Code will never disappear, as it defines the precise details machines need. Vague needs can't
  create exact results, and formal detail is required for machines to work.

### Bad Code

- Bad code slows everyone down. If you've struggled with it, ask yourself why you added to the
  problem by writing it.
- In a rush, we often leave messy code thinking we'll fix it later. But as LeBlanc's law says, later
  equals never.

### The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

- Messy code slows progress drastically. As systems grow, changes become harder, bugs multiply, and
  eventually the mess feels impossible to fix. As messy code grows, productivity drops.
- Neglecting clean code leads to failed redesigns, long delays, and endless cycles of messy systems.
  Clean code isn't optional—it's key to long-term success.
- Attitude:
  - Code degrades not just from external pressures but from our own lack of professionalism. The real
    cause of messy code often lies within the developers themselves.
  - Just as doctors must refuse unsafe procedures, programmers must defend clean code, even against
    pressure, to act professionally and protect quality.
- The Primal Conundrum: Making messy code to go faster is a false shortcut. Clean code is the only
  way to move quickly and meet deadlines without sacrificing quality.
- Knowing clean code matters is not enough. Like art, recognizing good code doesn't mean you know
  how to create it—you must learn how to write it well.
- Clean code comes from discipline and a developed “code-sense” that guides programmers to transform
  messy code into elegant, effective systems.
- What is Clean Code?
  - *Bjarne Stroustrup*: I like my code to be elegant and efficient. Code should be clear, minimal,
    reliable, and fast to stay clean and maintainable. Clean code does one thing well.
  - *Grady Booch*: Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean
    code shows intent clearly with sharp abstractions and simple control flow.
  - *Dave Thomas*: Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original
    author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names and one way to do one thing.
  - *Michael Feathers*: Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is
    nothing obvious that you can do to make it better.
  - *Ron Jeffries*: Runs all the tests; Contains no duplication; Expresses all the design ideas that
    are in the system; Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, etc.
  - *Ward Cunningham*: Clean code feels right when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much
    what you expected. Beautiful code makes it feel like the language fits the problem perfectly.

### Schools of Thought

- This book shares one approach to clean code, shaped by experience. It's not absolute truth, but
  its insights are worth learning from and considering alongside other perspectives.

### We Are Authors

- Code is read more than it's written. Like authors, programmers must write clearly for readers who
  will later rely on and judge their work.
- Since we read code far more than we write it, making code easy to read is key to writing it
  efficiently and working faster overall.

### The Boy Scout Rule

- Writing good code isn't enough. To prevent decay, we must keep it clean over time.
- The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule: *Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.*
- Small, consistent improvements prevent code rot. Making code better with every change reflects
  true professionalism and ensures continuous progress.
